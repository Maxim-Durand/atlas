With our setup complete, let's now turn to focusing on what it's like to work with Atlas in a local development environment.

This section assumes that you have been following along with the previous sections and have already set
up your project configuration file and schema.

## Applying migrations locally

During development, developers often need to provision a local database with the latest schema.

For the purpose of this guide we will assume that you have created a local database using docker and have stored
the connection URL to it in an environment variable named `$LOCAL_DB_URL`.
