Hi everyone,

I hope you are enjoying the holiday season, because we are here today with the last Atlas
release of 2023: [v0.17](https://github.com/ariga/atlas/releases/tag/v0.16.1).  It's been
only a bit over a week since our last release, but we have some exciting new features we
couldn't wait to share with you:

* **Trigger Support** - Atlas now supports managing triggers on MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB and SQLite databases.
* **Improved ERDs** - You can now visualize..
* **Automatic Schema Documentation** - ..

Without further ado, let's dive in!

### Trigger Support

### Improved ERDs

### Automatic Schema Documentation

### Wrapping up

That's it! I hope you try out (and enjoy) all of these new features and find them useful.
As always, we would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zZ6sWVg6NT).
